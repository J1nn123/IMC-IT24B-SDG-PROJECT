              <h2>What is our product?</h2>
              <p>Our product is a webapp that provides a map of a school's PCs and Printners that are available for the students to use.
                  Other than that, it also comes with elementary features like the ability to reserve a pc within a specific room, occupy said room, free a pc, or reset/clear.
                  However, these are assumptive features which clients can integrate into their systems, modify, or remove them entirely.

              <h2>What makes this important?</h2>
              <p>In situations where one of the school's problems stems from underutilized services and resources such as PCs and Printers, having a map of them can be helpful.
                  Not only will students be informed of where such resouces and services are, with some additions, like in our example, students
                  will become informed of whether they are free or otherwise, and would have the chance to use them if the former is true. Moreover, it would help students without
                  personal desktops or even laptops in activities/projects that requires the aforementioned whilst reducing hindrances that may arise.
