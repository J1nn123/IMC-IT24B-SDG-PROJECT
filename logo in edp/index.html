            <h2>What is our product?</h2>
            <p>Our product is a webapp that provides a map of a school's PCs and Printners that are available for the students to use.
                Other than that, it also comes with elementary features like the ability to reserve a pc within a specific room, occupy said room, free a pc, or reset/clear.
                However, these are assumptive features which clients can integrate into their systems, modify, or remove them entirely.
            </p>

            <h2>How do you use our product?</h2>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> Press any of the pins of the map.<br><br>
                <strong>2.</strong> Make a decision between "Use" and "Occupy," then press the corresponding button.<br><br>
                <strong>"USE"</strong><br>
                This option is for those wishing to borrow a room outside of class schedules.<br>
                <strong>"OCCUPY"</strong><br>
                This option is for those desiring to tell everyone a room is occupied due to class or some official reason.<br><br>
                <strong>3.</strong> After use, you either press "Free" to free-up the PC you've used or "Clear" after occupying it.

            <h2>What makes this important?</h2>
            <p>In situations where one of the school's problems stems from underutilized services and resources such as PCs and Printers, having a map of them can be helpful.
                Not only will students be informed of where such resouces and services are, with some additions, like in our example, students
                will become informed of whether they are free or otherwise, and would have the chance to use them if the former is true. Moreover, it would help students without
                personal desktops or even laptops in activities/projects that requires the aforementioned whilst reducing hindrances that may arise.
